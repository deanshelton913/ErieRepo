This is an example of a production-grade dockerized python webserver running behind a uwsgi-class reverse proxy.

## Architecture

python > uwsgi/nginx > flask

## Getting Started

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Then visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a damn spaceship. Or use a browser, whatever.
