<h1 align="center">AI Progress</h1>

<p align="justify">I have not bothered with any AI development, and I think this will never again be discussed..</p>

	I am currently installing Tensor Flow with Keras, PyCharm, and Anaconda!
	I am really excited! Just a little forsight, prediction. People in the future will have
	AI models of them selfs. These models will predict how strongly or weakly they will be
	in all parts of their life. Grades, Physically, everything. So people will start working
	towards their weaknesses. This will create a future AI model that will eventually will
	predict who will be the ones to shore up their weaknesses and will predict EVERYTHING omg.
	I'm rambling. Basically, I find no end to the power of AI, if this stuff even works....
	I'm hopefully gonna find out! I'm running through my first tutorial with TechWithTim. I've
	completed parts 1-3 of his tutorials....and I've gotta say, I'm a little confused. I know that
	if I look at it longer, I can understand some more, but it will take a while. I'm considering
	moving on for now.

	First off, my AI progress is minimal. I've concluded
	that I will install Tensor Flow on my CPU and not on my GPU because
	I am a gamer. In the future, I will build a machine that will have
	the sole purpouse of computing AI routines. Dreams do come true.
